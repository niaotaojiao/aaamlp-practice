This repository documents my learning journey based on the book *[Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/approachingalmost) by Abhishek Thakur*.


## Introduction

Welcome to my machine learning practice repository! Here, I've documented my learning process following the guidance of the book *[Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/approachingalmost)*. You'll find datasets, code, and other resources related to the book.

All datasets mentioned in the book have references and are available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/aaamlp). Additionally, the pneumothorax PNG images are accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/siim-png-images).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/niaotaojiao/aaamlp-practice.git`
2. Create the Conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activate the environment: `conda activate ml`

If you face problems with the environment files, please try the following instead

```
delete the ml enviornment that was created earlier: conda env remove --name ml

create a new environment: conda create -n ml python=3.7.6

activate the environment: conda activate ml

install python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
```
